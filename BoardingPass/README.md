# Boarding Pass - Team Project # 1

## Description

Takes input from a user consisting of their personal information as well as their travel details.  Processes that input, 
calculates an ETA to their destination and calculates their ticket price, and then outputs a .pdf document containing their 
boarding pass.  Past boarding passes are also stored in a file that allows a user to lookup an already existing boarding pass.
